Fully Configurable &amp; Reusable Admin e-Commerce Dashboard

This is a standalone e-commerce dashboard that can be easily reconfigured to use with any type of store to manage inventories, categories, and orders to name a few. 

Built with Next.js, React and TypeScript it uses reusable pieces of logic to make the code as efficient as possible. The frontend relies on Tailwind and Shadcn ui to speed up the client interface building process. User management is delegated to a trustworthy 3rd party which in this case is Clerk Authentication. 

All data is managed by a relational database and sent to Prisma queried by PlanetScale. The dashboard also supports light/dark and system themes achived with Next.js theme provider.

At this point it's completely functional but certain aspects are still being improved, so it's yet to be deployed and is now available in plain code to fork.
