## Bug
When you log in you are likely to see the "error occured on client side" popup. Simply reload the page, and it will disappear. 
This doesn't happen on localhost but nevertheless the bug is already being addressed. Also currently working on mobile optimization, so it's highly recommended to use on a desktop for now.
